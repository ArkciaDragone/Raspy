# Music Lab - beta v0.2.0

Welcome to Music Lab beta version!

It's simple to start: run startMidi.py. However, you need to pre-install four packages: statistics, numpy, mido, pprint.

The program first requires you to input, following the instructions, the path of your midi file. Putting your file directly on desktop is recommended, so that all you have to do is entering "-/Users/*your-user-name*/Desktop/*your-file-name*.mid". The hyphen at the beginning is vital, otherwise your input will be seen as an internal command in Minecraft, thus blocking the program.

After that, the program will let you choose your own way of configuring the redstone system. That is to say, the configuration will be done based on your choice.

If the midi file is successfully processed, you can then enter your in-game name (or another player's name), so that the redstone music system can be constructed beside the corresponding player.

The program is currently only able to process midi files that don't contain moments of 16 or more notes playing. Otherwise, the tempo always stays the same, which is planned to be changed in the near future.

You are more than welcome to help us fix bugs and create pull requests. Wish happy redstone-music-ing!
